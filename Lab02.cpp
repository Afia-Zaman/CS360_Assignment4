// 2. Generate a class called Rational to perform arithmetic with fractions. Write a program to
// test your class. Use integer variables to represent the private data of the class--the
// numerator and the denominator. Provide a constructor that enables an object of this
// class to be initialized when itâ€™s declared. The constructor should contain default values
// in case no initializers are provided and should store the fraction in reduced form. For
// example, 2
// 4 , the fraction would be stored in the object as 1 in the numerator and 2 in the
// denominator. Provide public member functions that perform each of the following tasks:
// a. Adding two Rational numbers. The result should be stored in reduced form.
// b. Subtracting two Rational numbers. The result should be stored in reduced
// form.
// c. Multiplying two Rational numbers. The result should be stored in reduced
// form.
// d. Dividing two Rational numbers. The result should be stored in reduced form.
// e. Printing Rational numbers in the form a/b, where a is the numerator and b is
// the denominator.
// f. Printing Rational numbers in floating-point format.
